Project for my OOP class. The point was to create an application that would be able to manage part of the activity of the programs of a university. In particular the application does the management of surveys corresponding to projects done by the students in the various classes in their program.


The guideline for the project is the following(written in portuguese): https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~david.matos/w/pt/index.php/Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_com_Objectos/Projecto_de_Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_com_Objectos/Enunciado_do_Projecto_de_2018-2019


The project was done using cvs instead of git since that was one of the requirements of the class. For this reason you might find a couple of folders related to cvs in the repository.
